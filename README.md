This project is my thesis entitled Noise Removal in Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging using Convolutional Autoencoder Network. This project uses Autoencoder Method and Convolutional Neural Network.

## Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images often contain noise, for example in brain imaging. The noise removal algorithm used is Convolutional Autoencoder Network (CAN) which produces a superior noise reduction effect compared to some other advanced algorithms. This research uses a dataset from Kaggle that contains 253 brain MRI images. The noise removal results using CAN on images with Gaussian noise type are higher than those of Rayleigh noise images. The average PSNR and SSIM improvement on Gaussian noise is 7.92 dB and 0.36, respectively. The average improvement of PSNR and SSIM on Rayleigh noise is 0.19 dB and 0.12, respectively.
